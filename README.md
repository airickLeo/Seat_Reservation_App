# Seat_Reservation_App

A Seat Reservation System built using 2D dynamic jagged array. The user can provide the structure of the seat arrangement in the txt file, an example seat arrangment is given in seats.txt. The user can also provide a txt file with the seat cost (please refer to the example txt file prices.txt). The system will read in from the txt files and generate the system to track the seat arrangements.
